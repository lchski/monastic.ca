<h1>Monastic</h1>
<p class="subtitle">A humble design practice</p>

<p class="intro">Monastic is the umbrella for Lucas Cherkewski’s professional work, solo and with friends.</p>

<p>Here’s what we value:</p>

<ol>
    <li>We do few things, well.</li>
    <li>We know that everything we do impacts people. As a result, we meet and work <em>with</em> those affected by our work, as dignified equals.</li>
    <li>We’re conscious and deliberate about <em>why</em> we exist—what and how we work flows clearly from that why.</li>
    <li>We don’t do work we don’t believe in, because we recognize that association is endorsement.</li>
    <li>We work <em>with</em> other people, but without too many layers—ours is a model of independent collaborators.</li>
    <li>We work alongside smart, extremely capable people who we can consider friends.</li>
    <li>We have a physical presence: in each others’ lives, in the lives of those we serve or work with, and in our community.</li>
    <li>We value sustainability and continuity. We’re not indispensable, but people work with us because we do excellent work. Furthermore, the planet isn’t hurt by our success.</li>
    <li>We value enduring quality—even if at our short-term disadvantage.</li>
    <li>We’re not precious about process or tools—we focus on outcomes, achieving them however best suits the situation. That said, everything we do is informed and constrained by our values: though we adapt our approach, we insist on respecting some ethical lines.</li>
    <li>We deliver concrete value—people walk away satisfied, without needing to justify their experience or expense.</li>
    <li>We do enough to get by, happily.</li>
    <li>We enable others, facilitating their success.</li>
</ol>
